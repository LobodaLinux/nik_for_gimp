Notes:

* Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Wine Staging v1.9.14 using Nik Collection v1.2.11, and GIMP v2.9.5 (from git).
* Make sure that Windows OS version set for wine is set to XP.
* Depending on your system specs the apps can take some time to start.

Issues:

* GIMP will complain with the message 'Incompatible type for "RichTIFFIPTC"; tag ignored' after using some of the apps. If you click ok, the error will go away and everything will work.

Credits:

* Initial scripts and information was had from Erico Porto at https://github.com/ericoporto/NikInGimp (his version required PlayOnLinux, if you prefer it rather than using standard wine or wine staging these plugins do then definitely give it a try).
